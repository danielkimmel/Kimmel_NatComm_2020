# Data from Kimmel et al, Nat Comm, 2020

Released here are the data from Kimmel, D. L., Elsayed, G. F., Cunningham, J. P. & Newsome, W. T. [Value and choice as separable and stable representations in orbitofrontal cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17058-y). *Nat. Commun.* 11, 1â€“19 (2020).  

*Please cite this paper when using all or part of the provided data*

We provide both the raw neural spiking data (see [raw_data](raw_data/)) as well as the processed results (see [results](results/)) for animals "N" and "K" in MATLAB's .mat file format.

Kimmel et al. analyzed these data using the [Optimal Targeted Dimensionality Reduction](https://github.com/danielkimmel/oTDR) (oTDR) software package, which can be downloaded separately. We recommend reviewing the [oTDR demo](https://github.com/danielkimmel/oTDR/test/test_oTDR.m) to familiarize oneself with the data format.
